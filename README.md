This repository contains code for two different Haskell programs and Matlab code used to produce results and figures in the paper “Kill Rates by Immune Cells: Ratio-dependent, or Mass Action?” by Ami Radunskaya and Joshua Sack.  

One Haskell program is for an in vitro simulation of tumor immune cell interaction, and the other Haskell program is for an in vivo simulation of tumor immune cell interaction.  Compiling main.hs will produce the executable for one of these, while the other can be produced by commenting out two lines and uncommenting two lines.  The file infoHaskell.rtf includes details about how to go between the in vitro and in vivo programs, and also includes information about how to install, compile, and run Haskell.

The file infoMatlab.rtf is a guide to the MatLab code used to produce some of the images in the paper.
